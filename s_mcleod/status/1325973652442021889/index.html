  	      I have witnessed this first hand, a friend of mine was a @harveynormanNZ store manager and he quit because of how disgusting the business's culture was - they were _deliberately_ ripping off and up-selling to at-risk and elderly people on an almost daily basis cc/@choiceaustralia <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_veyret/status/1325903808199757824">https://twitter.com/patrick_veyret/status/1325903808199757824</a>

  	      One story from #HarveyNorman - a person who was very clearly intoxicated came in, he wanted to buy a stereo, the staff (&amp; manager) got together &amp; decided to have a bet to see how much stuff they could sell him - he ended up spending thousands of $ on a huge home theatre system
